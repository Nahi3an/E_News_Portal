Mobile courts will be operated countrywide to penalise violations of the health guidelines.\r\n\r\nBus, launch and train must operate at half capacity. The authority concerned will issue a specific notice on the matter along with the date the restriction will take effect. Drivers and their assistants in vehicles must provide proof of vaccination.\r\n\r\nTo dine at restaurants, a vaccine certificate must be furnished, while students aged 12 years and above will not be allowed to attend classes in-person unless they are vaccinated after January 15.\r\n\r\nNo visitors will be allowed at airports. All international arrivals will have to show a negative COVID-19 certificate and undergo a rapid antigen test.\r\n\r\nOnly truck drivers will be allowed at the land port, while screenings at all ports will be increased. Embargoes would be imposed on crews to prevent them from leaving the vessels.\r\n\r\nThe measures are expected to contain the latest surge in Covid-19 cases, driven most likely by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.\r\n\r\nThe variant has undergone 50 genetic changes, making it more transmissible than the dominant Delta variant and more likely to evade the immune protection provided by vaccines or previous infection.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, it is causing a fresh wave of coronavirus cases the world over, compelling governments to enforce measures to restrict social mixing.\r\n\r\nIn Bangladesh, the official tally of Omicron cases stands at 31, after 10 new cases were reported yesterday by the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b).\r\n\r\nSamples from all of the patients were collected before December 28, according to the data published on the global database GISAID.\r\n\r\nBut health officials believe the fast-multiplying variant is causing the spike in cases witnessed in recent days.\r\n\r\nIn the 24 hours to 8 am yesterday, the country logged in 2,231 new cases -- the highest since September 10 last year. In the preceding 24 hours, 1,491 new cases were registered.\r\n\r\nThe case positivity rate yesterday was 8.5 percent --the highest since September 5.\r\n\r\nVaccinated patients are more likely to experience milder disease if infected by the Omicron variant, while a booster dose is said to provide bigger and broader protection against the rogue variant.\r\n\r\nIn Bangladesh, the rate of vaccination is modest: as of January 6, 39 percent of the targeted population and 31 percent of the total population have received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).\r\n\r\nThe health ministry will take necessary measures and initiatives to expedite the COVID vaccination campaigns.\r\n\r\nStudents, who have thus far not been a major focus of the vaccination campaign, will be given special attention.\r\n\r\nHours before the cabinet division issued the notice, Education Minister Dipu Moni at a press conference said they have taken a target of inoculating more than 75 lakh students aged between 12 and 18 by January 31.\r\n\r\nThere are about 1.16 crore students aged between 12 and 18. Of them, 44 lakh have got the first dose while another 4.2 lakh have completed Covid-19 inoculation.\r\n\r\nAs many as 75.5 lakh students are yet to get the vaccine.\r\n\r\n\"Earlier, we faced complexities on vaccine preservation and registration. We have overcome the problem now. The DGHS is not seeking much documentation. The whole process has become easier for our students,\" she said.\r\n\r\nIf a student above 12 years of age shows the relevant documents, he/she can get the vaccine, she said, while suggesting the students take at least a dose to attend classes in person.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the education ministry is due to sit today to discuss vaccination of students of National University, Open University and Islamic Arabic University as a large number of the students from the institutes remain unvaccinated.\r\n\r\nAs of now, there is no plan to halt in-person classes, while the SSC and HSC exams will be held in the middle of the year, she said.\r\n\r\nThe education ministry will also heighten monitoring at the educational institutions to ensure the health guidelines are being followed properly.', '2022-01-11 02:15:12', '2022-01-11', 'IMG-61dc93d0b6cc7.jpg', 1, 2),

But the BB intervenes in the foreign exchange market from time to time in the interest of the economy.\r\n\r\nThe local currency has been facing pressure in recent months in the wake of escalating imports and falling remittance inflow.\r\n\r\nAgainst the backdrop, the central bank injected dollars into the market on a regular basis in order to contain the depreciation of the taka.\r\n\r\nFor instance, banks have so far purchased around $2.50 billion from the central bank this fiscal year to settle their import bills. As a result, foreign exchange reserves are declining.\r\n\r\nImport payments stood at $31.16 billion between July and November, up 54 per cent year-on-year.\r\n\r\nRemittances narrowed 21 per cent year-on-year to $10.23 billion in the first six months of the fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe BB official said the depreciation of the local currency would discourage businesses from importing luxurious items while encouraging expatriate Bangladeshis to send their hard-earned money through the formal sector.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this will also give a boost to exporters, he said.\r\n\r\nThe foreign exchange reserves stood at $44.36 billion on January 6 in contrast to $46.4 billion on June 30 last year.

(18, 'Bangladesh Bank to weaken taka in phases', 'The Bangladesh Bank is considering to follow the path of a gradual depreciation of the taka against the US dollar in order to protect the interests of exporters and remitters.\r\n\r\nThe move, however, may stoke the inflationary pressure, which is building up owing to the kinks in the global supply chain, rising imports and shipping costs, and a slowdown in remittances. \r\n\r\nThe central bank devalued the interbank exchange rate on Sunday, allowing the local currency to rise to Tk 86 against USD for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"The BB is considering a gradual appreciation of the dollar against the taka to give a boost to both exporters and remitters,\" Md Habibur Rahman, acting chief economist of the central bank, told The Daily Star.\r\n\r\nThe country import payments have escalated due to the global supply chain disruption and the rising domestic demand from the industrial sector soon after the economy reopened.\r\nThe central bank has little scope to address the disruption, said Rahman.\r\n\r\n\"Although it is good for the economy if the market determines the exchange rate, the central bank will not expect an uncontrolled state in the foreign exchange regime,\" said Rahman, also an executive director of the BB.\r\n\r\n\"We are monitoring the inflationary pressure cautiously, which is why the central bank is thinking of a gradual depreciation of the local currency.\"\r\n\r\nAnother central bank official, on condition of anonymity, says that the BB has planned to depreciate the local currency closed to Tk 87 per dollar step by step this year given the state of the economy.\r\n\r\nBut Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, a think-tank, called for immediate devaluation.\r\n\r\n\"If it does not take the move promptly, the country foreign exchange reserves will diminish.\"\r\n\r\nThe former official of the International Monetary Fund recommended the depreciation of the local currency to at least Tk 88 per dollar without further delay.\r\n\r\n\"This will help remitters send their hard-earned money through banking channel.\"\r\n\r\nThe central bank has been injecting dollars into the market on a regular basis since the inception of the current fiscal year to stop any steep fall of the local currency.\r\n\r\nBanks have purchased around $2.50 billion from the central bank to settle import bills.\r\n\r\nThe BB allowed the local currency to be cheaper by more than Tk 1 in the last one year as the interbank exchange rate stood at Tk 84.80 on January 10 last year.\r\n\r\nThe depreciation, however, has not helped contain the escalation of the import payments, which stood at $31.16 billion in the first five months of the current fiscal year, up 54 per cent year-on-year.\r\n\r\nThe situation has worsened for falling remittances, which were down 21 per cent at $10.23 billion in the first half of 2021.\r\n\r\nAlthough exports have picked up significantly in recent months, it has failed to offset the imbalance created in the foreign exchange market by the lower remittances and higher imports.\r\n\r\nAgainst the backdrop, the foreign exchange reserves slipped to $44.36 billion on January 5 in contrast to $46.39 billion on June 30 last year. The reserves had surpassed $48 billion in August last year.\r\n\r\nWhen his attention was drawn to the inflationary pressure stemming from the depreciation of the taka, Mansur said: \"The overall macroeconomic stability is more important than containing the inflation.\"\r\n\r\nHigher inflation has become a common phenomenon across the globe.\r\n\r\nPent-up demand fueled by stimulus and pandemic disruptions is helping accelerate inflation, spread around the world through global factors like higher food and energy prices, and soaring shipping costs, according to the IMF.\r\n\r\n\"When someone faces economic crisis, he or she should cut down consumption. Imports will automatically go down if the taka devalues,\" said Mansur.\r\n\r\nIn Bangladesh, the Consumer Prices Index rose 28 basis points to a 14-month high of 6.05 per cent in December, with non-food inflation reaching 7 per cent, a six-year high and food inflation to 5.46 per cent, the highest in six months.\r\n\r\nMansur says the deficit in the current account has already gone past $6 billion, and the shortfall may widen to $15 billion at the end of the fiscal year if the current trend continues.\r\n\r\n\"How will we manage the deficit? We will have to take foreign loans to manage the situation. Otherwise, the reserves will nosedive.\" \r\n\r\nNaser Ezaz Bijoy, chief executive officer of Standard Chartered Bangladesh, said that the exchange rate should be determined by the market.\r\n\r\n\"The rate will continue to face pressure if commodity prices in the global market do not decline,\" he said, adding that the pressure on the exchange rate would ease if the government can manage soft loans from external sources.\r\n\r\nSyed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, said that the peer countries of Bangladesh had devalued their currencies significantly.\r\n\r\n\"We should take the same measures in the interests of the export sector.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Emranul Huq, managing director of Dhaka Bank, and Mirza Elias Uddin Ahmed, managing director of Jamuna Bank, welcomed the central bank initiative aimed at depreciating the taka.\r\n\r\nThe exchange rate in the kerb market is, however, Tk 89.70 per dollar.

(19, '\r\nAkij Tableware aims to be a product of choice', 'It has been a decade Akij Ceramics Ltd, a concern of Akij Group, has been operating in the ceramic industry in Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nA well-known producer of tiles, the firm growing popularity was reflected after it became the best brand for three consecutive years to 2021. It is now the second-biggest tiles maker in the country in terms of sales and production.\r\n\r\nBuoyed by the initial success, the company has recently introduced tableware to tap the growing demand for quality crockeries of ceramics among the fast expanding middle class and well-off consumers as well as to explore the global market.\r\n\r\n\"As per capita income is growing dynamically, the opportunity is also growing dynamically,\" SK Bashir Uddin, managing director of Akij Group, told The Daily Star in an interview recently.\r\n\r\n\"Once you achieve certain standards, the whole world is yours. We believe that the category itself and the demand out there in the world will generate business that we are looking forward to.\"\r\n\r\nBashir firmly believes that the company will be able to contribute to the sector.\r\n\r\n\"First, we will export. Second, we will substitute imports.\"\r\n\r\nAkij Ceramics has so far invested more than Tk 1,000 crore in its ceramics plant since it started operation in 2012. For tableware, it invested more than Tk 200 crore in order to meet the growing demand for quality products now met through imports.\r\n\r\n\"Clearly, there is a sizeable upper middle class aspiring to have modern living. And Bangladesh now imports a huge amount of ceramics crockeries to meet demand for products with aesthetic and technical feature. We think this has created a space,\" Bashir said.\r\n\r\nAkij Ceramics grew almost 300 per cent in the last 10 years in terms of revenue and capacity and has added new and diversified products.\r\n\r\n\"Overall, our experience in the ceramics industry has been very good,\" the industrialist said, adding that Akij Ceramics today is a profitable company.\r\n\r\nHe says the factory is now operating at a capacity equivalent to the capacities of large ceramic factories in Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nThe plant has a capacity to manufacture 55,000 pieces of tableware per day and it aims to raise the capacity to 1.25 lakh pieces per day before the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nThe additional capacity will make the company one of the biggest tableware factories not just in Bangladesh but also in the region.\r\n\r\nBut for Akij Ceramics, the idea is not only to be big in size. Rather, its target is to bring that level of diversity to the products that are import-substitutes and exportable.\r\n\r\n\"Tableware is a mix of artisan, mechanical activity and appropriate raw material to get perfect whiteness, the perfect shine, which is seen in high-quality porcelain products,\" said Bashir.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that we have been able to reach that level and we will be able to do it better.\"\r\n\r\nBashir says businesses have to offer value to customers for a product, whether in the form of product diversity, price, availability or the combination of the three or beyond the three.\r\n\r\n\"Akij makes products so that consumers find them higher in value than the price they pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"The value must by either by utility or by its function. It must generate that value for me to bring your hard-earned money to my company.\"\r\n\r\nThe entrepreneur also shared his views about tariff protection given to the local ceramics industry, importance of cutting the cost of doing business to prepare for competition after Bangladeshs graduation from the group of the least-developed countries, and improving efficiency.\r\n\r\nHe thinks continuous spoon-feeding or long-term protection is not good for any industry. \r\n\r\n\"A definite roadmap is necessary for businesses to prepare for competition globally.\"\r\n\r\nHe suggested bringing uniformity to rules and regulations, curbing corruption and bringing down the cost of doing business with a view to helping firms increase their competitiveness.\r\n\r\nOn Bangladesh graduation to a developing country due in 2026, the entrepreneur calls for launching a massive awareness campaign so that businesses can plan and take preparation accordingly.\r\n\r\nHe recommended increasing investment in energy efficiency to improve systems and process.\r\n\r\nAs an organisation, Akij Group, with its 80 years of legacy, is continuously trying to improve efficiency.\r\n\r\n\"We are active and we are relentlessly working to be better in competition and increase efficiency,\" Bashir said.\r\n\r\nThe growing ceramics industry is not without challenge.\r\n\r\nFor example, the labour cost has increased in the last 10 years and Akij has tried to offset the additional expenditure by augmenting productivity.\r\n\r\n\"We have invested in energy efficiency and introduced high productive machines,\" said Bashir.\r\n\r\nWhen the group decided to invest in tableware, it had analysed productivity and energy efficiency of major tableware factories in detail and set an ambitious target: productivity must be 50 per cent higher and energy cost must be a minimum 50 per cent lower.\r\n\r\n\"We have achieved the targets,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, we have had to make additional investment, but we think this investment has not been done unnecessarily,\" said Bashir, adding the reduced cost, improvement in productivity and efficiency would enable Akij to provide better products to local and foreign customers.\r\n\r\n\"We have been able to reduce [product] rejection significantly. We work with difficult targets. For this, we bring together best minds,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBashir says heating up to 1,400 degree Celsius is required for the beautification of a porcelain product, resulting in carbon emission.\r\n\r\n\"But we have been able to cut emission by 50 per cent which is a very ambitious target.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not only environmentally sensitive, it is also giving us an advantage commercially.\"', '2022-01-11 12:53:19', '2022-01-11', 'IMG-61dd295f8e578.jpg', 1, 12),

It will take a month to get there and another five months before its infrared eyes are ready to start scanning the cosmos.\r\n\r\nFirst, the telescope enormous mirror and sunshield need to unfurl; they were folded origami-style to fit into the rocket nose cone. Otherwise, the observatory wont be able to peer back in time 13.7 billion years as anticipated, within a mere 100 million years of the universe-forming Big Bang.\r\n\r\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson called Webb is a time machine that will provide \"a better understanding of our universe and our place in it: who we are, what we are, the search that is eternal.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are going to discover incredible things that we never imagined,\" Nelson said following liftoff, speaking from Florida Kennedy Space Center. But he cautioned: \"There are still innumerable things that have to work and they have to work perfectly ... we know that in great reward there is great risk.\"\r\n\r\nIntended as a successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope, the long-delayed James Webb is named after NASA administrator during the 1960s. NASA partnered with the European and Canadian space agencies to build and launch the new 7-ton telescope, with thousands of people from 29 countries working on it since the 1990s.\r\n\r\nWith the launch falling on Christmas and a global surge in COVID-19 cases, there were fewer spectators at the French Guiana launch site than expected. Nelson bowed out along with a congressional delegation and many contractors who worked on the telescope.\r\n\r\nAround the world, astronomers had eagerly waited to see Webb finally taking flight after years of setbacks. Last-minute technical snags bumped the launch nearly a week, then gusty wind pushed it to Christmas. A few of the launch controllers wore Santa caps in celebration.\r\n\r\n\r\nProtecting the observatory is a wispy, five-layered sunshield, vital for keeping the light-gathering mirror and heat-sensing infrared detectors at subzero temperatures. At 70 feet by 46 feet (21 meters by 14 meters), it is the size of a tennis court.\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, the sunshield will be opened three days after liftoff, taking at least five days to unfold and lock into place. Next, the mirror segments should open up like the leaves of a drop-leaf table, 12 days or so into the flight.\r\n\r\nIn all, hundreds of release mechanisms need to work — perfectly — in order for the telescope to succeed. \"Like nothing we have done before,\" said NASA program director Greg Robinson.\r\n\r\nRetired astronaut-astronomer Steven Hawley is more stressed over Webb than he was for Hubble, which he released into orbit from space shuttle Discovery in 1990. That is because Webb will be too far away for rescuing, as was necessary when Hubble turned out to have blurry vision from a defective mirror.\r\n\r\nSpacewalking repairs by astronauts transformed Hubble into a beloved marvel that has revolutionized humanity understanding of the universe, casting its eyes as far back as 13.4 billion years. It is now up to Webb to draw even closer to the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, its infrared vision keener and more far-reaching than Hubble is in the shorter visible and ultraviolet wavelengths.\r\n\r\nNASA is shooting for 10 years of operational life from Webb. Engineers deliberately left the fuel tank accessible for a top-off by visiting spacecraft, if and when such technology becomes available.\r\n\r\nWhen he released Hubble, \"I never would have believed that it would still be going strong almost 32 years later,\" Hawley, now professor emeritus at the University of Kansas, said in an email. \"I hope that in 32 years we will be able to say that JWST did as well.\"', '2022-01-11 13:07:17', '2022-01-11', 'IMG-61dd2ca507251.jpg', 1, 7),

Other than being packed with nutrients, it is loaded with antioxidants, antibacterial and anti-fungal properties. Honey is also said to help relieve digestive problems and may improve heart and brain health, making it a must-have element in your diet.\r\n\r\nBy replacing sugar in coffee or tea, you may swap the negative effects for the perks provided by honey. It is a natural energy source and having it with warm water every morning can provide you with a boost of energy to start the day. A warm cup of milk before sleep prepares one for the chilly night ahead and adding honey to it increases its benefits by manifolds.\r\n\r\nApart from health advantages, honey is widely used in skin and haircare regimen owing to its beneficial qualities.
